# Rebase Branch

Rebasing is another method for integrating changes from one branch into another. Unlike merging, 
which creates a new commit that combines the changes from two branches, rebasing moves or combines a 
sequence of commits to a new base commit.

Operation similar to a merge, use the "Rebase" button in the toolbar or rebase selected branch in to current from context menu.
