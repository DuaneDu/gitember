# Gitember

September, October, November, December, Gitember. Just another git gui client. 

## Reason to create 

Nothing in particular, but 
 * I had some free time in december and wanted to check is JavaFx suitable for GUI programming
 * I dont like standard gui of git.

## Road map

### Next version

 * Add ssh protocol support
