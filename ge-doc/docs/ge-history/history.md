# History

The project history functionality in Gitember provides a comprehensive 
view of your project's commit history, including merges, branches, and individual 
commits. It allows you to perform various operations on commits and view detailed 
information about each commit.

# Overview of Project History

 * Navigate to the History Tab: Go to the main toolbar and select the 'History' tab.

## History Visualization
