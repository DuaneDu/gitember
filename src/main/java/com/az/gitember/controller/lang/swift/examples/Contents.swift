//: ## Control Flow
//:
//: Use `if` and `switch` to make conditionals, and use `for`-`in`, `while`, and `repeat`-`while` to make loops. Parentheses around the condition or loop variable are optional. Braces around the body are required.
//:
let individualScores = [75, 43, 103, 87, 12]
var teamScore = 0
for score in individualScores {
    if score > 50 {
        teamScore += 3
    } else {
        teamScore += 1
    }
}
print(teamScore)

//: In an `if` statement, the conditional must be a Boolean expression—this means that code such as `if score { ... }` is an error, not an implicit comparison to zero.
//:
//: You can use `if` and `let` together to work with values that might be missing. These values are represented as optionals. An optional value either contains a value or contains `nil` to indicate that a value is missing. Write a question mark (`?`) after the type of a value to mark the value as optional.
//:
var optionalString: String? = "Hello"
print(optionalString == nil)

var optionalName: String? = "John Appleseed"
var greeting = "Hello!"
if let name = optionalName {
    greeting = "Hello, \(name)"
}

//: - Experiment:
//: Change `optionalName` to `nil`. What greeting do you get? Add an `else` clause that sets a different greeting if `optionalName` is `nil`.
//:
//: If the optional value is `nil`, the conditional is `false` and the code in braces is skipped. Otherwise, the optional value is unwrapped and assigned to the constant after `let`, which makes the unwrapped value available inside the block of code.
//:
//: Another way to handle optional values is to provide a default value using the `??` operator. If the optional value is missing, the default value is used instead.
//:
let nickname: String? = nil
let fullName: String = "John Appleseed"
let informalGreeting = "Hi \(nickname ?? fullName)"

//: Switches support any kind of data and a wide variety of comparison operations—they aren’t limited to integers and tests for equality.
//:
let vegetable = "red pepper"
switch vegetable {
    case "celery":
        print("Add some raisins and make ants on a log.")
    case "cucumber", "watercress":
        print("That would make a good tea sandwich.")
    case let x where x.hasSuffix("pepper"):
        print("Is it a spicy \(x)?")
    default:
        print("Everything tastes good in soup.")
}

//: - Experiment:
//: Try removing the default case. What error do you get?
//:
//: Notice how `let` can be used in a pattern to assign the value that matched the pattern to a constant.
//:
//: After executing the code inside the switch case that matched, the program exits from the switch statement. Execution doesn’t continue to the next case, so you don’t need to explicitly break out of the switch at the end of each case’s code.
//:
//: You use `for`-`in` to iterate over items in a dictionary by providing a pair of names to use for each key-value pair. Dictionaries are an unordered collection, so their keys and values are iterated over in an arbitrary order.
//:
let interestingNumbers = [
    "Prime": [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13],
    "Fibonacci": [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8],
    "Square": [1, 4, 9, 16, 25],
]
var largest = 0
for (_, numbers) in interestingNumbers {
    for number in numbers {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number
        }
    }
}
print(largest)

//: - Experiment:
//: Replace the `_` with a variable name, and keep track of which kind of number was the largest.
//:
//: Use `while` to repeat a block of code until a condition changes. The condition of a loop can be at the end instead, ensuring that the loop is run at least once.
//:
var n = 2
while n < 100 {
    n *= 2
}
print(n)

var m = 2
repeat {
    m *= 2
} while m < 100
print(m)

//: You can keep an index in a loop by using `..<` to make a range of indexes.
//:
var total = 0
for i in 0..<4 {
    total += i
}
print(total)

//: Use `..<` to make a range that omits its upper value, and use `...` to make a range that includes both values.
//:


//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)

//: ## Functions and Closures
//:
//: Use `func` to declare a function. Call a function by following its name with a list of arguments in parentheses. Use `->` to separate the parameter names and types from the function’s return type.
//:
func greet(person: String, day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet(person: "Bob", day: "Tuesday")

//: - Experiment:
//: Remove the `day` parameter. Add a parameter to include today’s lunch special in the greeting.
//:
//: By default, functions use their parameter names as labels for their arguments. Write a custom argument label before the parameter name, or write `_` to use no argument label.
//:
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}
greet("John", on: "Wednesday")

//: Use a tuple to make a compound value—for example, to return multiple values from a function. The elements of a tuple can be referred to either by name or by number.
//:
func calculateStatistics(scores: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int, sum: Int) {
    var min = scores[0]
    var max = scores[0]
    var sum = 0

    for score in scores {
        if score > max {
            max = score
        } else if score < min {
            min = score
        }
        sum += score
    }

    return (min, max, sum)
}
let statistics = calculateStatistics(scores: [5, 3, 100, 3, 9])
print(statistics.sum)
print(statistics.2)

//: Functions can be nested. Nested functions have access to variables that were declared in the outer function. You can use nested functions to organize the code in a function that’s long or complex.
//:
func returnFifteen() -> Int {
    var y = 10
    func add() {
        y += 5
    }
    add()
    return y
}
returnFifteen()

//: Functions are a first-class type. This means that a function can return another function as its value.
//:
func makeIncrementer() -> ((Int) -> Int) {
    func addOne(number: Int) -> Int {
        return 1 + number
    }
    return addOne
}
var increment = makeIncrementer()
increment(7)

//: A function can take another function as one of its arguments.
//:
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -> Bool) -> Bool {
    for item in list {
        if condition(item) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
func lessThanTen(number: Int) -> Bool {
    return number < 10
}
var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)

//: Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it’s executed—you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (`{}`). Use `in` to separate the arguments and return type from the body.
//:
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -> Int in
    let result = 3 * number
    return result
})

//: - Experiment:
//: Rewrite the closure to return zero for all odd numbers.
//:
//: You have several options for writing closures more concisely. When a closure’s type is already known, such as the callback for a delegate, you can omit the type of its parameters, its return type, or both. Single statement closures implicitly return the value of their only statement.
//:
let mappedNumbers = numbers.map({ number in 3 * number })
print(mappedNumbers)

//: You can refer to parameters by number instead of by name—this approach is especially useful in very short closures. A closure passed as the last argument to a function can appear immediately after the parentheses. When a closure is the only argument to a function, you can omit the parentheses entirely.
//:
let sortedNumbers = numbers.sorted { $0 > $1 }
print(sortedNumbers)



//: [Previous](@previous) | [Next](@next)
